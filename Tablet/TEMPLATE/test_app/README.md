## How to Build

To build the test_app unit test application:

1. Install the **blackberry.template** extension, following the instructions found in that code's README file.
2. Click on the **Downloads** tab above.
3. Select **Download as zip** (Windows) or **Download as tar.gz** (Mac) and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
4. Create a new folder on your local machine named **test_app** e.g. **C:\Documents and Settings\User\WebWorks\test_app** (Windows) or **~/WebWorks/test_app** (Mac).
5. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and extract the contents **from inside the zipped test_app folder** to your local **test_app** folder from step 3.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the local **test_app** folder (e.g. **~/WebWorks/test_app/config.xml**).
6. Using the **[Ripple Mobile Emulator](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** and either the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphone](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** or the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Tablet OS](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)**, package the contents of your local **test_app** folder into a BlackBerry application.  Enter the project root settings field as the local folder created in step 3, and the archive name settings field as **test_app**.
