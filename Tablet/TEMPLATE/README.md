## How to install this extension

1. Download the source from this repository and extract it to a location on your computer.

2. Using File Explorer browse to the downloaded source code for this extension: _**Tablet\TEMPLATE**_.

3. Copy the downloaded _**Tablet\TEMPLATE\blackberry.template**_ directory to the extensions directory for the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Tablet OS. The default path for this location is _**C:\Program Files\Research In Motion\BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for TabletOS\bbwp\ext**_.

**NOTE:** Be sure to back-up this _**ext\blackberry.template**_ directory in your WebWorks SDK extensions directory before performing a WebWorks SDK upgrade. Simply copy it back into the _**ext**_ directory after you have completed your SDK upgrade.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter Air Packager exceptions when building your WebWorks app, it likely means there is a syntax or compiling error within your extension code.

How to test?  Suggest building a sample WebWorks app, similar to **test_app**, that uses JavaScript unit tests to evaluate 
test your extension.

Note: You can can use Web Inspector to check runtime values and set breakpoints for JavaScript, however you cannot
use Web Inspector to debug into the AIR layer (from JavaScript).

## TODO
1. Refactor this sample. Is there any way to make it easier to understand by simplifying the code?

## Required Feature ID
Whenever you use the below feature id in any of your WebWorks applications this extension will be loaded for use.

    <feature id="blackberry.template" />
