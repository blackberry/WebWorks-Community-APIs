	`+  client.js`
	
	`+  index.js`

	`+-device/libclipboard.so`
	
	`\-simulator/libclipboard.so`


2. in your `config.xml` file, add the following line feature:


	`<feature id="community.clipboard" required="true" version="1.0.0.0"/>`


3. in your app, use the following code to call the extension:

	`community.clipboard.getText();`
	
	`community.clipboard.setText("String");`
