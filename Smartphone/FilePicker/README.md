# File Picker
The file picker control will allow you to prompt your user to browse to a file.  This is necessary because the HTML input field of type "file" will not allow you to read or set the file path that the user 
entered.  If you need to request a file and then manipulate the file in your JavaScript, you will need this file picker extension.

## How To Configure The Extension For Use

1. Locate your BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphone extensions directory using your File Explorer.  Default path is _**C:\Program Files\Research In Motion\BlackBerry WebWorks Packager\ext**_

2. Create a new _**webworks.ui.filePicker**_ directory in the _**ext**_ directory

3. Download the source from this repository and unzip it to a location on your computer

4. Using File Explorer browse to this extension's downloaded source code _**Smartphone\FilePicker**_

5. Copy the _**library.xml**_ file from the downloaded _**Smartphone\FilePicker**_ directory to your new _**ext\webworks.ui.filePicker**_ directory

6. Copy the downloaded _**Smartphone\FilePicker\src**_ directory to your new _**ext\webworks.ui.filePicker\src**_ directory

**NOTE:** Be sure to back-up this _**ext\webworks.ui.filePicker**_ directory in your WebWorks SDK extensions directory before performing a WebWorks SDK upgrade. Simply copy it back into the _**ext**_ directory after you have completed your SDK upgrade.

## Required Feature ID
Whenever you use the below feature id in any of your WebWorks applications this extension will be loaded for use.

    <feature id="webworks.ui.filePicker" />

## Summary

    static void open(callback : function (filePath : Number) ) // If nothing is selected undefined is returned

   
## Code Example

    <html>
		<head>
		<meta name="viewport" id="viewport" content="height=device-height,width=device-width,user-scalable=no" />
		<script type="text/javascript" >
		  function doClick() {
				webworks.ui.filePicker.open(doCallback);
		  }
		  
		  function doCallback(file) {
			alert('You selected file: ' + file);
		  }
		</script>
		</head>
		<body >
		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<button onclick="doClick()">Click Me</button>
		</body>
	</html>

## Usage Information
When creating a spinner control you will pass it a callback function that will 
be invoked once the user selects a file.  If no file is selected the callback will
have undefined returned to it


_**NOTE:**_ The callback is handled asynchronously, so code that is placed directly after
the "open" function call will be executed immediately while waiting for the user's 
response input.

_**NOTE:**_ If you override the back key in your application (_**blackberry.system.event.onHardwareKey(blackberry.system.event.KEY_BACK, myExit);**_) 
you will need to null this out (_**blackberry.system.event.onHardwareKey(blackberry.system.event.KEY_BACK, null);**_) 
before calling _**webworks.ui.filePicker.open**_. If you donâ€™t do this, your app will perform the override action
when a user clicks back in the FilePicker instead of moving back a directory or even closing the picker. 
Remember to re-associate your exit function in the FilePicker callback.
