## Usage

### Constants

SendCommand Types (the primary data type you're looking to send):

* blackberry.ui.sendmenu.TYPE_PATH
* blackberry.ui.sendmenu.TYPE_TEXT

Context JSON Keys:

* blackberry.ui.sendmenu.PATH
* blackberry.ui.sendmenu.SUBJECT
* blackberry.ui.sendmenu.TEXT

###  Methods

#### blackberry.ui.sendmenu.add( TYPE, CONTEXT [, GET_ALL, ORDERING, PRIORITY, FILTER ] )

Adds the Send Menu to the app's menu.

Arguments:

* `TYPE` is one of the above `TYPE_PATH` or `TYPE_TEXT` constants
* `CONTEXT` is a JSON string with valid keys `PATH`, `SUBJECT` and/or `TEXT`
* `GET_ALL` (optional) is a boolean indicating whether to get all commands, regardless of availability (defaults to `FALSE`)
* `ORDERING` (optional) is an integer indicating menu ordering (defaults to 0)
* `PRIORITY` (optional) is an integer indicating menu priority (defaults to 0)
* `FILTER` (optional) is a JSON string similar to `CONTEXT` which replaces values in `CONTEXT` based on command filters (in testing this had no affect on commands I thought it would, ie: Twitter or SMS limits), leave null for none

#### blackberry.ui.sendmenu.remove()

Removes the Send Menu previously added in the current application session (the menu will not persist between sessions).

#### blackberry.ui.sendmenu.setLabel( STRING_LABEL )

Sets the parent menu label for the sub menu containing all send commands. Defaults to `Share`.

## Example

	var context = {};
	blackberry.ui.sendmenu.setLabel('Send...');
	context[blackberry.ui.sendmenu.SUBJECT] = 'This is an e-mail subject';
	context[blackberry.ui.sendmenu.TEXT] = 'This message was sent from my WebWorks app!';
	blackberry.ui.sendmenu.add(blackberry.ui.sendmenu.TYPE_TEXT,JSON.stringify(context));
